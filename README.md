# 	 Fashion Illustration by Chaw

Fashion illustration is a form of art that focuses on creating visual representations of clothing and accessories. It involves using various drawing techniques and styles to showcase fashion designs, trends, and ideas. Fashion illustrators often use different mediums such as pencils, markers, watercolors, or digital tools to bring their ideas to life.

In fashion illustration, attention to detail is crucial. Illustrators pay close attention to fabric textures, garment silhouettes, and the overall aesthetic of the fashion piece they are portraying. They aim to capture the essence and mood of the design, effectively conveying the designer's vision.
